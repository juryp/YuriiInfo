Run in the terminal:

```console
npm run format

npm run format:check

npm run lint:ls

npm run lint:md

npm run spell-check
```

Or all command in one string with sleep 2 second

```console
npm run format; sleep 2; npm run format:check; sleep 2; npm run lint:ls; sleep 2; npm run lint:md; sleep 2; npm run spell-check
```

After checking, I made sure that there were no errors and started working with
git commands:

```console
git status

git add .

git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

git push --set-upstream origin Br2
```
